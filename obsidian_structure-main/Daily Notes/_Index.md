# Daily Notes Hub

This note serves as your chronological log and central hub for daily reflections, tasks, fleeting notes, and a record of what happened each day. By consistently using properties in your daily notes, you'll be able to create powerful views once Obsidian Bases are available.

## 1. Preparing Your Daily Notes

The foundation for Bases is consistent metadata. Ensure your `Daily Note Template` (`00 Meta/Templates/Daily Note Template.md`) includes relevant properties in its frontmatter.

## 2. Future Bases Views (Examples)

Once Obsidian Bases is publicly released, you will be able to create and embed `.base` files directly into this `Daily Notes Hub` note. These will automatically update to show your daily data.
