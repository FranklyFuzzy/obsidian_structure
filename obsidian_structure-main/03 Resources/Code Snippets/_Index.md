# Code Snippets Hub

This section is a curated collection of reusable scripts, command-line one-liners, and code fragments. These snippets are designed to be practical tools for various tasks, such as parsing logs, data manipulation, or automation.

---

## Purpose
To quickly find, understand, and reuse code snippets that perform specific functions, streamlining repetitive tasks and documenting useful techniques.

## Future Bases View (Examples)

Once Obsidian Bases is publicly released, you will be able to create and embed `.base` files directly into this `Code Snippets Hub` note.
