# Projects Hub

This note serves as your central dashboard for managing and visualizing all your projects. By consistently using properties in your project notes, you'll be able to create powerful views once Obsidian Bases are available.

## 1. Preparing Your Project Notes

Ensure your `Project Brief Template` (and any other project-related notes) includes relevant properties in its frontmatter, as outlined in `00 Meta/Templates/Project Brief Template.md`.

## 2. Future Bases Views (Examples)

Once Obsidian Bases is publicly released, you will be able to create and embed `.base` files directly into this `Projects Hub` note. These will automatically update to show your project data.

### All Projects - Table View (Example)

_(This section will be replaced by an embedded Base view)_

### Active Projects - Filtered View (Example)

- [[Project Alpha Start/Project Alpha Start]] (Due: 2025-07-15, Priority: High)

## 3. Manual Navigation (Current Bridge)
Until Bases is fully rolled out, you can still use simple methods for navigation.

**Explanation of Project properties:**
- **`project_name:`**: The primary identifier for your project.
- **`status:`**: Crucial for filtering active/completed projects.
- **`due_date:`**: Enables sorting by deadlines.
- **`priority:`**: Helps you prioritize your work.
- **`client:`**: Useful for client-specific projects.
- **`project_lead:`**: Identifies who is responsible.
- **`area:`**: Connects the project to a broader area of responsibility (e.g., your "Work" area).
- **`tags: project`**: A consistent tag to easily identify all project notes.
