# My Obsidian Vault Map

Welcome to my personal knowledge base. This vault is structured to facilitate discovery and connection across my projects, areas of responsibility, and resources, while providing clear homes for different types of information. It prioritizes consistent properties for future database views with Obsidian Bases.

## Core Conventions

* **Naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD` for daily notes. Keep filenames descriptive and concise.
* **Linking:** Link proactively between notes to build a connected web of knowledge.
* **Tagging:** Use tags for orthogonal classification (e.g., `#status/active`, `#type/meeting`, `#person/JohnDoe`).
* **Properties (Frontmatter):** Consistently use YAML frontmatter at the top of notes for structured data, essential for future Obsidian Bases functionality.
