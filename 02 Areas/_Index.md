# Areas Hub

This note serves as your central dashboard for managing and visualizing all your ongoing responsibilities, roles, and continuous learning areas. By consistently using properties in your Area notes (e.g., the `_Index.md` in each sub-area), you'll be able to create powerful views once Obsidian Bases are available.

## 1. Preparing Your Area Notes

Ensure your main Area Index notes (like `Learning/_Index.md`, `Personal/_Index.md`) include relevant properties in their frontmatter, as outlined in `00 Meta/Templates/Area Note Template.md` (which I provided a general structure for earlier).

## 2. Future Bases Views (Examples)

Once Obsidian Bases is publicly released, you will be able to create and embed `.base` files directly into this `Areas Hub` note. These will automatically update to show your area data.

### All Areas - Table View (Example)

_(This section will be replaced by an embedded Base view)_

|Area Name|Type|Status|Last Reviewed|Key Focus Areas|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Learning|Area|Active|2025-06-15|Python, History, AI|
|Personal|Area|Active|2025-06-18|Health, Journal, Finances|
|Work|Area|Active|2025-06-19|Client Mgt, Team Dev|

### Active Areas - Filtered View (Example)

_(This section will be replaced by an embedded Base view)_

- [[Learning/_Index|Learning]] (Last Reviewed: 2025-06-15, Focus: Python, History, AI)
- [[Personal/_Index|Personal]] (Last Reviewed: 2025-06-18, Focus: Health, Journal, Finances)
- [[Work/_Index|Work]] (Last Reviewed: 2025-06-19, Focus: Client Mgt, Team Dev)

## 3. Manual Navigation (Current Bridge)

Until Bases is fully rolled out, you can still use simple methods for navigation.

### Your Active Areas

- [[Learning/_Index|Learning Hub]]
- [[Personal/_Index|Personal Hub]]
- [[Work/_Index|Work Hub]] (You'd likely create this as `02 Areas/Work/_Index.md`)
